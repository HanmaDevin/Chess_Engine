# Chess_Engine
## Project Status

Still in development, may contain bugs. 

## About

Like the name suggests it's an engine which you can 
play against

This is a project based on this tutorial:

## How to run

Just go to the scripts folder and run the run.sh script.
You can do it with the following commands in your terminal:
1. open a terminal in the scripts directory, right click and use the option "open terminal here"
2. then type this in your terminal
```shell
chmod -x ./run.sh
./run.sh
```
If that does not work, I will fix this in the future, 
just download the requirements down below

## Requirements

You need to install python and pygame

You can download python here:

## How to run

Just go to the scripts folder and run the run.sh script.
If that does not work, I will fix this in the future, 
just download the requirements down below

## Requirements

You need to install python and pygame

You can download python here:
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Afterward check if the installation was successful
```shell
python3 --version
```

Pygame is installed via the pip command, which comes 
with the python install

Run the following in your preferred shell

```shell
pip install pygame
```
Now check if it was successful
```shell
pygame --version
```
